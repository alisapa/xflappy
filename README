xflappy - Flappy bird clone for X11

Written in C89 for pure Xlib (no frameworks).
Just a side-project written in two days, so it was only tested on Gentoo Linux,
but there is no reason why it shouldn't run on other UNIX-like systems.
Very slow systems might require an adjustment of DELAY (see: config.h).

I know that the bird looks terrible. I can't draw any better sprites.

Compiling and installing:
- Ensure that Xlib headers are installed. On Gentoo, that is "x11-libs/libX11",
  on Debian, that is "libx11-dev", and so on.
- make
- make PREFIX=/whatever/path install

Highscore is stored in a file ".xflappy-highscore" in the current user's home
directory. To reset the highscore, simply delete that file.
